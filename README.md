# 📚 Homework no. 1 | 🍱 Flexbox/Grid Challenge
_Phase one of my front-end journey_

## 🤓 What I learned

- Getting `display: grid` and `display: flex` to play nice is really tough (especially when it comes to responsivity
- How to incorporate `@media` queries with more purpose to achieve a specific layout
- To actually improve you need to be fine with not being perfect from line 1 (and the whole separate climb of refactoring)

## 😬 What needs work

- Overall comfortability with CSS properties
-- This took way longer than it had to, basically lived on MDN and W3, and still most of my time was spent trialing and erroring in the dev tools
- Need to better understand the full capabilities of CSS layout (think much of my code is suboptimal and inelegant compared with the 'right' way of doing things
- My units are all over the place, must get more comfortable knowing where/when/how to use each
- Didn't use variables, but already seeing the power of them for any kind of scale
-- _**Note:** would've been super cool to leverage variables in the SVGs (which I think is possible if they're inline)_

## 🔑 Key takeaways:

- This is fun!
- There's a lot to know
- That's half the fun
